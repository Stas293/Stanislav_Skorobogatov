To run the project you will need to have Java 17 installed on your computer.

You can open the project in your IDE and run the tests from there.

You can run the tests using the following command

        mvn clean test

This will build the project and run the tests.

The project is configured to run the tests in parallel. The number of threads is set to 8.
This can be changed in the pom.xml file.

The task implementation can be found in the src/main/java/org/projects/development directory.
Additional tasks are also implemented here.

Tests can be found in the src/test/java/org/projects/development directory.
